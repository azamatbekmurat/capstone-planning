## Description

This is React car dealership website for selling new and used cars. As an owner I want to be able to add car into the list making available for customers to see them.

## Current features:

* There is a list of all available cars. Each car has its make, model, model year, price, mileage(odometer), transmission, type, condition and color.

* There are search bar and filter to list cars according to customer preferences.

* There is a form where a new car for sale can be added to the list.

## Future features:

* As an admin, I want the option to edit a car's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

* As an admin, I want to be able to click a button to update car's status to 'sold'.

* As an admin, I want to be able to delete car from the list.

* As a client, I want to have cars prices to be color-coded for easy readability.

* As a patron, I want to see new cars separately from used cars
